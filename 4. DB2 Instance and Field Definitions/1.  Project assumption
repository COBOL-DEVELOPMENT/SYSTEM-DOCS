## 1. Basic Environment Assumptions

The project is implemented within the existing z/OS DB2 operational framework.  
Physical database components, including DATABASE, STOGROUP, BUFFERPOOL, and VSAM dataset structures, are governed by established operational standards.

## 2. Architectural Assumptions

The existing 3270 channel remains unchanged for core legacy operations.  
A new web channel is introduced through API-based integration, enabling coexistence with the legacy transaction flow without requiring modifications to core programs.

## 3. Data Flow Assumptions

DB2 remains the system of record for all transactional data, ensuring data integrity and consistency across both legacy and web channels.
